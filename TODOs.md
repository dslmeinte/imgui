- make possible to use multiple instance in a single page (put everything in an object)

- make "here" resilient against passing the yielded function to other functions. Currently 
  it only works if it's called within the closure.

- remove "body" patching.

- let event-handling render not build Vnodes.

- add assertions to check input params.

- garbage collect view states.

- perhaps remove try-finally, since exception handling does not seems to be common in JS (and slow...)

- make some elements both accept string and block (e.g. p).

- separate widgets in other lib

- remove dep on jwerty (use proceed pattern)

- allow event delegation via root, not just document.

- make document injectable
